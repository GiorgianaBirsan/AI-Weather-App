## Notes

This is the app build within the LinkedIn Learning course 'Build a JavaScript AI App with React and the OpenAI API'. The full course is available from LinkedIn Learning.

In this course, I learned how to integrate the OpenAI API into a web app, about API integration, task-based API configuration, and sending and receiving requests to the API.
